# Installing VS Code
* The first step is to install VS code if you haven't already. If you have taking a class with Joe before, you very likely already have VS Code installed
* You can download VS Code [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Pick the right version for your computer.

* VS Code is an IDE that we will use for this class. The home screen should look something like the image below.
